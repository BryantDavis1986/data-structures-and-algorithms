# Daily Code Challenge Hash Table

## Perfect Sequence

### Problem Domain

Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## API
GetHash - finds the location/Index where the key and value are stored
Add - Places a new node that consists of a key and value into a linked lists at a given index of the table array
Get - Finds and returns the value of the node that matches that of the key entered
Contains - verifies if a key exists inside of the table and returns a boolean
